Hi, I’m @Levan-Kakashvili

I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I have experience building and deploying machine learning models for a variety of applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive modeling.

I have a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics, and am proficient in programming language and databases such as Python, PostgreSQL and SQL. I also have experience with a variety of machine learning frameworks and libraries, including TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a track record of working effectively in cross-functional teams and am able to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest advancements in the field and participating in online machine learning communities and hackathons.
